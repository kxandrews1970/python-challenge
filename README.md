# python-challenge
#This one started out fine, then it came to the second part.  For now I am submitting this part so I will have something in.  I will try to get the 2nd one uploaded tonight or tomorrow
disclosure.. i found some code i borrowed here: https://github.com/shrawantee/Python-PyBank-and-PyPoll/tree/master/HomeworkPython not line for line but it helped fill in my gaps.  Then i lost pandas in my python account locally, i probably need to reboot but again, i need to get something in before midnight.
